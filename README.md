   DETR Model Architecture
</p>


This repo hosts the integration of vision transformer, namely Swin Transformer, to the transformer based Object Detection model, namely DETR for robust Object Detection. Swin transformer implementation is based on [here](https://github.com/berniwal/swin-transformer-pytorch) and DETR is based on [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr). For the sake of simplicity, demo version of DETR is used. Please contact me for further questions.
