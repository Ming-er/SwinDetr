# SwinDetr

This repo hosts the integration of vision transformer, namely Swin Transformer, to the transformer based Object Detection model, namely DETR for robust Object Detection. Swin transformer implementation is based on [here](https://github.com/berniwal/swin-transformer-pytorch) and DETR is based on [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr). For the sake of simplicity, demo version of DETR is used. Please contact me for further questions.
